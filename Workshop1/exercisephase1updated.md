```
Available tools:
- @github: GitHub repository operations
  - create issue
  - list issues
  - show pull requests
  - search code
  [... more tools]
```

**Test 2: Test Repository Access**

In **Copilot Chat**, type:
```
@github Can you access the CanarysPlayground/ai-sdlc-brownfield-workshop repository?
```

**Expected Response:**
- ✅ Copilot confirms it can access the repository
- May show repository information (branches, recent commits, issues)

**Test 3: List Open Issues** (Simple Query)

```
@github List the open issues in CanarysPlayground/ai-sdlc-brownfield-workshop
```

**Possible Responses:**

✅ **Success:**
```
Found X open issues:
- Issue #Y: [Title]
- Issue #Z: [Title]
```
or
```
No open issues found in this repository.
```

- [ ] Toast is accessible (screen reader announces)

Technical Implementation:
- Install or use existing toast library (e.g., react-hot-toast)
- Modify `frontend/src/components/entity/product/Products.tsx`:
  - Import toast notification library
  - In handleAddToCart function, show toast after successful add
  - Format: `toast.success('Added ${productName} to cart')`
- Add CSS animation to CartIcon:
  - Create pulse animation in Tailwind or CSS
  - Trigger animation class when cart updates
  - Remove animation class after 500ms

### CART-ICON-003: Cart State Persistence

User Story: As a user, I want my cart to persist when I refresh the page, so that I don't lose my selected items.

Scope: Ensure cart state is saved to localStorage and restored on app load.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Cart items saved to localStorage on every change
- [ ] Cart items loaded from localStorage on app initialization
- [ ] Cart icon shows correct item count after page refresh
- [ ] Cart works across browser tabs (same cart data)
- [ ] Invalid data in localStorage handled gracefully

Technical Implementation:
- Modify CartContext (frontend/src/context/CartContext.tsx):
  - Add useEffect to save cart to localStorage on state change
  - Add useEffect to load cart from localStorage on mount
  - Use key: 'octocat-cart'
  - Handle JSON parse errors (invalid data)
  - Clear cart if data structure doesn't match
