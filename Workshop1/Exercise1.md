    "figma": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-figma"
      ],
      "env": {
        "FIGMA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": ""
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 1.3 Get Figma Personal Access Token
- Open Figma in your browser

---

### **STEP 4: Use the Architecture Diagram in this location
    [Architecture Diagrams](supply-chain-system/docs/architecture.md)



### **STEP 5: Extract Design Specifications** (20 minutes)

#### 5.1 Access Design Resources

**Option A: If you have a Figma file**
- Open the Figma file provided or create one
- Copy the File URL
- Extract the File ID from the URL: `https://www.figma.com/file/{FILE_ID}/...`


#### 5.2 Extract Design Specs Using Figma MCP Use copilot Agent


#### 5.3 Create Design Spec Document
- Create new file: `docs/specifications/product-page-design-spec.md`
- Paste the generated design specifications
- Save the file

#### 5.4 Verify Design Spec Content
Ensure your design spec includes:
- [ ] Color Palette (Primary, Secondary, Neutral colors with hex codes)
- [ ] Typography (Font families, sizes, weights, line heights)
- [ ] Component Specifications (Product Card dimensions, spacing, shadows)
- [ ] Spacing System (base unit, margins, padding)
- [ ] Responsive Breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] Interactive States (hover, active, focus, disabled)
- [ ] Accessibility notes (contrast ratios, focus indicators)
