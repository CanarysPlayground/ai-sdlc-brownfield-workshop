<summary><h3>⚙️ STEP 4: CONFIGURE GITHUB MCP </h3></summary>

<br>

Before creating the GitHub Issue, you need to activate and configure GitHub MCP (Model Context Protocol) in VS Code.

#### What is GitHub MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a standardized protocol that lets GitHub Copilot (especially Agent Mode) access structured tools such as:
- GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and repository operations
- File operations and content access
- Custom local or remote tools
- Your own MCP servers for specialized functionality

MCP bridges the gap between AI assistants and your development environment, enabling programmatic access to GitHub and other services.

---

#### 4.1 Prerequisites

Before configuring the GitHub MCP Server,

**Verify Prerequisites:**

1. Open VS Code
2. Check bottom-right corner for GitHub Copilot icon
3. Ensure you're signed into GitHub (bottom-left account icon)

---

#### 4.2 Install the GitHub MCP Server (Recommended Method)

This is the **official and easiest** way to configure GitHub MCP. It connects VS Code to GitHub's hosted MCP server—**no local runtime required**.

**Step 1: Search for GitHub MCP Server**

1. In the VS Code **Extensions search bar**, type:
   ```
   github mcp server
   ```

2. Locate **GitHub MCP Server** in the search results
   - Publisher: GitHub
   - Look for the official GitHub badge

**Step 2: Install the Server**

1. Click **Install** on the GitHub MCP Server extension
2. Wait for installation to complete
3. VS Code may prompt for permissions—grant them

**Step 3: Verify Installation**

1. Open **Command Palette**:
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   - macOS: `Cmd+Shift+P`

2. Type and select:
   ```
   MCP: List Servers
   ```

3. You should see **`github`** listed as a configured server


> 📚 **Reference**: [GitHub Docs - GitHub MCP Server](https://docs.github.com)

---

#### 4.3 Enable Agent Mode (Required for MCP Tooling)

GitHub MCP is deeply integrated with **GitHub Copilot Agent Mode**. Agent Mode allows Copilot to use MCP tools directly (e.g., create issues, list branches, modify files).

**Step 1: Open VS Code Settings**

1. Open **Settings**:
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+,`
   - macOS: `Cmd+,`

2. In the search bar, type:
   ```
   chat.agent.enabled
   ```

**Step 2: Enable Agent Mode**


#### 4.4 Verify MCP Setup and Test Connection

Before creating issues, verify that GitHub MCP is fully operational.

**Test 1: List Available Tools**

In **Copilot Chat**, click on tools icon:
```
type github in command palette and se the tools available

```

**Test 2: Test Repository Access**

In **Copilot Chat**, type:
```
@github Can you access the CanarysPlayground/ai-sdlc-brownfield-workshop repository?
```
→ **MCP is working! Proceed to next Step**
