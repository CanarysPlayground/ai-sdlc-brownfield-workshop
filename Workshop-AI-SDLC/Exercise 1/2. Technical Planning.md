**Workshop** : Development Persona 
**Technical Planning & Scaffolding with Spec Kit**

### **Scenario**

Building on Phase 1's GitHub Issue for the **Cart Icon with Item Count Badge**, you'll now use GitHub Copilot Spec Kit to:

Break down the feature into frontend and backend technical tasks
Create design guardrails aligned with existing architecture
Generate specifications and scaffold cart components (UI + API)
Prepare structured implementation plans with clear milestones

### **Learning Objectives**
By completing Phase 2, you will learn to:
- ✅ Use GitHub Copilot Spec Kit to break down features into executable tasks
- ✅ Create AI agent development guardrails for consistent architecture
- ✅ Generate feature specifications, technical plans, and implementation tasks
- ✅ Apply Spec Kit commands (/specify, /plan, /tasks, /clarify, /analyze)
- ✅ Structure full-stack implementation with clear milestones

## 🎯 **PREREQUISITES**

### **Required Tools**
- ✅ Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot extension
- ✅ GitHub Copilot Chat with Spec Kit enabled
- ✅ GitHub MCP (Model Context Protocol) configured
- ✅ Git installed and configured
- ✅ Node.js 18+ and npm installed


### **Completion Requirements**
- ✅ **Phase 1 completed**: GitHub Issue created for Cart Icon feature
- ✅ **GitHub Issue Number**: Note your issue number from Phase 1 (e.g., #15)
- ✅ **Documentation from Phase 1**:
  - `docs/investigation/cart-issue-analysis.md`
  - `docs/knowledge-repository/high-level-design.md`
  - `docs/knowledge-repository/technical-design-document.md`
  - `docs/knowledge-repository/current-requirements.md`
  - `docs/knowledge-repository/missing-requirements.md`
  - `docs/specifications/cart-icon-feature-requirements.md`
  - `docs/github-issue-draft.md`

<br>

#### Step 1.1 — Install Spec Kit
1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to your project directory.
Use this command in your current directory:
    uvx --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git specify init --here

1. Follow the prompts to complete the installation.
   

#### Step 1.2 — Confirm Spec Kit Setup
```bash
specify check
```

<summary><h3> Step 2: Create Design Guardrails – agents.md </summary>
<br>

#### Step 2.1 Create File
```bash
.github/agents.md

```
Use the inline chat in VS Code by clicking on Ctrl+i in the agents.md file to add the following content:

#### Prompt Run in inline chat in the file agents.md:
```
# Write “AI Agent Development Guardrails – OctoCAT Supply Chain System” and include the following sections, Architecture Rules
- Frontend uses React + TypeScript (strict).
- Tailwind CSS only (no inline styles).
UI/UX Rules, Accessibility Rules, State & Logic, Backend Rules, Testing Rules
```


#### Step 2.2 /constitution — Update Project Constitution

Spec Kit tutorials explicitly show that /constitution updates the project constitution, and teams can extend it using custom files such as agents.md. 

This file tells Copilot/Spec Kit how your application must be built.

**Prompt 1: Update Constitution**
```/constitution
Update the project constitution to include the design guardrails from .github/agents.md for the OctoCAT Supply Chain System.
```

#### Step 2.2  /specify — Generate Feature Specification

The /specify command creates the high-level feature specification (what/why), based on your GitHub Issue and context.

**Prompt 1: Generate Feature Specification**
```
/speckit.specify 

Feature: Cart Icon with Item Count Badge

Use these context files:
- docs/github-issue-draft.md
- .github/agents.md

Produce:
- User stories
- Acceptance criteria
- Non-functional requirements
- API expectations
- Accessibility & dark mode requirements
Follow project constitution rules.
```

####  Step 2.3 — Optional: /clarify Loop
Use if Spec Kit identifies ambiguities.

**Prompt 2: Clarify Ambiguities**
```/speckit.clarify

Find unresolved questions in the cart icon spec and propose options +
recommended defaults following agents.md.
```

#### Step 2.4 — /plan — Technical Architecture Plan
The /plan command converts the spec into a technical plan.
(Supported in Spec Kit Quick Start: /speckit.plan creates technical architecture.)

**Prompt 3: Generate Technical Architecture Plan**
```
/speckit.plan

Generate a full-stack technical plan based on the spec + agents.md:

Include:
- Frontend files to create (types, context, CartIcon)
- Backend migration, repository, service, routes
- API contract shapes
- localStorage sync rules
- Testing strategy
- Milestones (Backend → Frontend → Integration → Tests)

Follow repository structure exactly.
```

#### Step 2.5 — /tasks — Produce Implementation Tasks

The /tasks command converts the technical plan into small, executable tasks.
**Prompt 4: Generate Implementation Tasks**
```
/speckit.tasks

Convert the technical plan into implementation tasks.

Requirements:
- Group by milestones
- Each task includes file path, expected output, test requirement
- Tasks should be 15–45 minutes each
- Add final “Definition of Done”

Follow agents.md guardrails.
```

#### Step 2.6 (Optional) /analyze — Quality Check
Use /analyze to validate the spec/plan/tasks.

**Prompt 5: Quality Check**
```/speckit.analyze

Evaluate constitution, spec, plan, tasks for:

- Alignment with agents.md
- Missing architecture decisions
- Risk areas
- Testability
- Completeness for implementation

Return: Ready, Warnings, Blocking Items.
```

**🎉 Congratulations!** You've completed technical planning and scaffolding for the Cart Icon feature!
