# Workshop : Development Persona
## Code Generation + PR Creation using GitHub Copilot Agents


### **Scenario**
Building on Enrich-Requirements (GitHub Issue creation) and Technical planning and scaffolding, you will now use **GitHub Copilot in Agent Mode** to implement the complete Cart Icon feature. This phase converts the Spec Kit outputs (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md) into real implementation code through GitHub Copilot Agent Mode.


### **Learning Objectives**
By completing Phase 3, you will learn to:
- ✅ Use GitHub Copilot Agent Mode to convert technical plans into functional code
- ✅ Implement full-stack features (frontend and backend) using AI-assisted development
- ✅ Apply design guardrails to ensure consistency with existing architecture
- ✅ Create and review pull requests with GitHub Copilot assistance
- ✅ Verify implementation alignment with original functional specifications

### **Completion Requirements**
- ✅ **Phase 2 completed**: Technical planning and scaffolding with Spec Kit
- ✅ **Spec Kit Outputs Generated**:
  - `.github/agents.md` (Design guardrails)
  - ensure the feature branch created during /speckit.
    specify contains the final versions of:
    spec.md
    plan.md
    tasks.md
    These files live under .specify/specs/<NNN-cart-icon>/ and represent the finalized blueprint for agentic implementation.
  - Implementation agents must follow:

    .github/agents.md (design guardrails)
    .specify/memory/constitution.md (project rules)
    .specify/specs/<NNN>/spec.md (requirements)
    .specify/specs/<NNN>/plan.md (architecture plan)
    .specify/specs/<NNN>/tasks.md (execution tasks)

- ✅ **Documentation from  Enriching Phase and technical design docs**:
  - `docs/github-issue-draft.md`
  - `docs/specifications/cart-icon-feature-requirements.md`

 </summary>
<br>

#### 1.1 Switch to the Feature Branch Created by /speckit.specify in VS Code

Spec Kit automatically creates a feature branch when running /speckit.specify.

    Method 1: Using the VS Code Branch Switcher
        **Step 1** — Open the VS Code Command Palette
            Press:
            Ctrl + Shift + P   (Windows/Linux)
            Cmd + Shift + P    (macOS)

        **Step 2** — Search for “Git: Checkout to…”
            Type:
            Git: Checkout to...

        Click it.

        **Step 3** — Select the Spec Kit–generated Branch
            Spec Kit creates a branch during /specify, usually named something like:
            
            spec-<feature-name>-001
            feature/cart-icon-badge-speckit
            speckit/cart-icon-<id>

        Just click the branch name.

        VS Code will switch your workspace to that branch instantly.

    Method 2: Using Source Control Side Bar

        Step 1 — Open Source Control
            Click the Source Control icon on the left sidebar (icon: branch symbol).
        Step 2 — Click the Current Branch Dropdown
            At the bottom of the VS Code window (Status Bar), click where it shows: main (or your current branch name).
        Step 3 — Select Your Feature Branch
            VS Code shows all branches.
        Click the branch that Spec Kit created during /speckit.specify.


<details>
<summary><h3> Step 2: Start Agentic Implementation (Use Tasks as Source of Truth)

Your /speckit.tasks file is the instruction list for Copilot Agent.
For each task, you will use the inline Copilot Agent prompt.

#### 🔧 2.1 Recommended Inline Prompt for Each Task
Open a file where the task applies, tasks.md file,
select the task you want to implement  then run:

#### Prompt: use copilot Local Agent to implement task:
``` 
    @workspace Implement the next task from:
    .specify/specs/<NNN-cart-icon-implementation>/tasks.md
    <Task number>

    Follow:
    - Technical plan (plan.md)
    - Feature specification (spec.md)
    - Design guardrails (.github/agents.md)
    - Constitution (.specify/memory/constitution.md)
    Apply changes only within this repository’s architecture.
    Generate high‑quality, production‑ready code.

```

#### 🧩 2.2 Implement Code in Small Increments
Repeat per task:

Open the file tasks.md

For each task:
Review changes
Save the file
Commit after meaningful increments

Example commit:
    Step 1 — Open Source Control View
        In VS Code, look at the Activity Bar on the left.
        Click the Source Control icon 

    Step 2 — Stage Your Changes (Equivalent to “git add .”)
        - Stage All Changes
        - In the Source Control panel, hover over CHANGES.
        - Click the plus icon (+) next to “CHANGES”.

    Step 3 — Enter Your Commit Message
        - At the top of the Source Control panel:
        - You’ll see an input box that says:
            Message (press Ctrl+Enter to commit)
        - Type your commit message, for example:
            feat(cart): implement CartContext state + localStorage sync

    Step 4 — Commit the Changes
        - Look for the ✓ Commit icon above the message box and Click it
        - VS Code will now create the commit.

    Step 5 — Push Your Commit to GitHub
        After committing:
        - In the lower-left status bar, click “Sync Changes”
        - Your commit is now uploaded to GitHub.

<summary><h3> Step 3: Generate PR Description with Copilot</h3></summary>
<br>

Once all tasks are implemented and committed, generate the PR description.

#### Prompt: Generate PR Description
```
@workspace Create a comprehensive PR description for this branch.

Include:

Summary of changes (frontend + backend)
Link back to GitHub Issue #<ISSUE_NUMBER>
Spec Kit artifacts used (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md)
Testing evidence (commands run + results)
Notes on guardrails compliance (agents.md, constitution.md)
Definition of Done checklist
Any follow-up work/out of scope
```
**Save Output:**
- Copy the generated PR description for the next step
