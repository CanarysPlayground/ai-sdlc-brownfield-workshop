**Workshop**: Testing Persona – Requirement to Test  
**Phase**: 3 of 3 (Test Execution & CI/CD Integration)

### **Scenario**
Building on Test Scenario generation and Automation Scripts generation, you will now execute the Playwright test suite, analyze results, and integrate tests into a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. This phase demonstrates automated testing in a continuous delivery workflow.

### **Learning Objectives**
By completing Execute tests, you will learn to:
- ✅ Execute Playwright tests locally and analyze results
- ✅ Debug failing tests using Playwright tools
- ✅ Generate and interpret test reports
- ✅ Create GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
- ✅ Set up test artifacts and reporting in CI/CD(to show the data on github actions based on the work flow generations)

## 🎯 **PREREQUISITES**

### **Required Tools**
- ✅ Playwright installed and configured
- ✅ GitHub Copilot extension enabled
- ✅ GitHub Actions access (enabled by default)

### **Completion Requirements**
- ✅ **Phase 2 completed**: All test scripts generated
- ✅ **Test Files Created**:
  - Page Objects (`tests/e2e/pages/`)
  - Test Specs (`tests/e2e/tests/`)
  - Fixtures (`tests/e2e/fixtures/`)
  - Helpers (`tests/e2e/helpers/`)
  - Configuration files (playwright.config.ts, package.json scripts)
- ✅ **Application Running**: Frontend and backend accessible
- ✅ **GitHub Repository**: Access to push changes and create workflows

#### 🚀 **PHASE 3: TEST EXECUTION & CI/CD INTEGRATION**

<details>
<summary><h3>🧪 STEP 1: EXECUTE TESTS LOCALLY</h3></summary>

<br>

#### 1.1 Run the Complete Test Suite

Execute all generated Playwright tests locally to validate the Cart Icon feature.

**Prompt 1: Run Tests and Generate Report**
```
@workspace Run the complete Playwright test suite for the Cart Icon feature.

Execute:
- All test specs in tests/e2e/tests/
- Generate HTML report
- Capture screenshots on failure
- Show test execution summary

Command: 
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```
Optionally:
#### Run and Debug Tests with Playwright Extension**

- Once the test scripts are generated, use the Playwright extension in VS Code to run and debug them.
- Review the test file created and if found any issues fix them asking copilot to /fix the issues in the test file
- Make sure your Frontend and backend servers are running:

    ```bash
    npm run dev   # Frontend
    npm start     # Backend API
    ```
    Now you can run the test
    ```bash
    npm run test:e2e    
    ```
 - To verify everything is set up correctly.
    ```bash
    npx playwright show-report

    ```
- This will take you to the Serving HTML report at
 http://localhost:9325

#### 1.2 Verify Test Coverage

Ensure all test scenarios from Test Scenario generation are covered.

**Prompt 2: Analyze Test Coverage**
```
@workspace Analyze test coverage for the Cart Icon feature.

Compare executed tests against:
- docs/testing/test-plan.md
- docs/testing/test-priority-matrix.md

Generate coverage report showing:
- Tests executed vs planned
- Pass/fail rates by category
- Gaps in test coverage
```

<summary><h3>🔧 STEP 2: DEBUG AND FIX TEST ISSUES</h3></summary>

<br>

#### 2.1 Debug Failing Tests

Use Playwright's debugging tools to identify and fix issues.

**Prompt 3: Debug Test Failures**
```
@workspace Debug failing Playwright tests.

For each failing test:
- Run in debug mode: npx playwright test --debug
- Check selectors and page objects
- Review error messages and screenshots

Fix issues by updating:
- Page object selectors
- Test assertions
- Test data
- Configuration settings
```

#### 2.2 Update Test Scripts

Apply fixes to ensure all tests pass.

**Prompt 4: Fix and Re-run Tests**
```
@workspace Fix identified test issues and re-run the suite.

Update files as needed:
- tests/e2e/pages/*.ts (selectors, methods)
- tests/e2e/tests/*.spec.ts (assertions, logic)


Re-run: npm run test:e2e
Verify all tests pass.
```

<details>
<summary><h3>🚀 STEP 3: SET UP CI/CD PIPELINE</h3></summary>

<br>

#### 3.1 Create GitHub Actions Workflow

Set up automated testing in CI/CD using GitHub Actions.

**Prompt 5: Generate GitHub Actions Workflow**
```
@workspace Create a GitHub Actions workflow for Playwright testing.

Workflow requirements:
- Trigger: Push to main branch and pull requests
- Jobs: Install dependencies, run tests, upload results
- Matrix: Test across multiple browsers (chromium, firefox, webkit)
- Artifacts: Upload test reports and screenshots
- Notifications: Comment on PRs with results

File: .github/workflows/playwright-tests.yml
Include proper Node.js setup and Playwright installation.
```

**Save Output:** Create `.github/workflows/playwright-tests.yml` and paste Copilot's response.

#after creating this yml file to trigger this CI CD pipeline push your changes to GitHub repository using github MCP

give me the steps

After creating the `.github/workflows/playwright-tests.yml` file, follow these steps to push your changes to the GitHub repository using GitHub MCP:
1. **Stage Your Changes**:
   Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory. Stage the new workflow file and any other changes you've made in VS code using source control panel.
2. **Commit Your Changes**:
   Use the following command to commit your changes with a descriptive message by clicking the Generate commit message icon in VS code source control panel to create the commit.
3. **Push to GitHub**:
   Push your committed changes to the remote repository using the following command or by clicking "Sync Changes" in VS code source control panel.
Prompt: Create Pull Request via MCP
```@github Create a pull request in CanarysPlayground/ai-sdlc-brownfield-workshop.
Title: "Setup GitHub Actions Workflow for Playwright Testing"
from source branch <NNN-cart-icon-implementation> to main branch.

Once the PR is merged the workflow will be triggered and you can check the workflow status in the Actions.
